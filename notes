TODO:
 - Fix issue on Colors page where color will default to black if first
   selected channel is one without a color attribute.
 - Fix tab management (of multiple tabs with the same type). Either with exclusion or tab IDs.
 - Fix Menu.DataTransmit listener overflow. (Where in the hell are they coming from?)
 - Change "New Patch" and other similar elements to modals/dialogs.
